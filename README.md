# todoapp_react

This repo features a todo React/Ruby on Rails app. The simple application demonstrates the use of React components, state, and properties.

<h1>React</h1>
React is a JavaScript user interface library which serves as the "view" in your application. It breaks down your application into components and works by manipulating the DOM. Two important properties in React are state and property. The state of a component changes, and it is only releveant to the view. The property of a component does not change, and it is passed between the parent and child.

<h2>To run this application:</h2>
>be rake db:create
>be rake db:migrate
>rails server

To view the full application, type the following into your browser: http://localhost:3000.
